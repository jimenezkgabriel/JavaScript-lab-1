1. How did you approach creating more flexible functions with parameters?
    Parameters are the locally defined variables to whatever gets passed into the function. These are flexible because they can be used to do calculations without affecting the original value that gets passed in. 
2. What challenges did you face while incorporating conditional logic in your functions?
    As I was testing for some boolean conditionals, I wanted to test putting in a wrong input such as the number 1 or number 0. I had to scratch my head as to why the wrong input was going in as valid. Doing some research I found out that JavaScript loosely defines 1 or 0 as true or false respectively!
3. How does refactoring improve the readability and maintainability of your code?
    Refactoring code is when you reorganize code to make it more readable or to completely change the algorithm of the code to be more optimal or to do computations faster, also can be more readable!
